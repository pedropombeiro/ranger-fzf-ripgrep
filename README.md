# ranger-fzf-ripgrep

[Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) plugin that allows navigation through searching with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

A ripgrep search can be initiated through e.g. a key mapping in `rc.conf` such as:

```
map rg console fzf_rg_select%space
```

Copied from the Ranger wiki [here](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Custom-Commands) so it can be installed with [ranger-plug](https://github.com/cjbassi/ranger-plug).
